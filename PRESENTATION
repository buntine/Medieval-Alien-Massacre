Notes for my presentation at the functional programmers meetup.

Text-based gaming
  - Popular from 1970 onwards.
  - The user interacts with the terminal by typing commands.
  - Early successes included Zork, Adventure! and Dunnet.
  - Relatively easy to write, but can be complex (language parsing, etc).
  - Super fun!
    - Total control over the story.
    - No need for artistic skill.
    - Add new commands at will.

Medieval Alien Massacre
  - Written in clojure, a LISP for the JVM.
  - Currently about 1200 lines - probably my largest lisp project.
  - A hobby project, inspired by Dunnet (written in emacs LISP).
  - All of the hard stuff is done, but the story is incomplete.

...Demonstration...

Who is familiar with LISP?
  - Give 5 minute intro to Clojure.
    - Released in 2007, but relatively unknown until 2009-ish.
    - Compiles to Java bytecode, so you can run it on the JVM.
      - So you get real Java interop.
        - You can use Java libraries.
        - You can write part/all of your app in Clojure and use it in Java projects.
    - Is a real LISP
      - Code is data.
      - S-Expressions.
    - A Lisp-1
      - There is no separate namespace for functions (looks more like Scheme than Common Lisp)
    - Has literal syntax for many data structures (not just lists)
      - Maps, Sets and Vectors
    - It goes further than older lisps and does not try to be code-compatible.
    - Functions are first-class (real closures)
    - Emphasis on higher-order functions and recursion over side-effect based looping, etc.
    - Supports lazy (infinite) sequences
    - Simplifies concurrent programming
    - Some examples:
      - Simple forms (+ 1 1), etc.
      - Write function and execute.
      - Lambda.
      - Higher-order function.
      - Basic Java interop.

How it's written
  - Show main files and explain role of each.
  - Open core and see how things get going.
  - Show language parsing.
    - Can get potentially complicated:
      - Give blue key to old man.
      - Give the fucking blue key to that old man over there.
  - Change the first room of the game.
    - Modify description
    - Add new object.
