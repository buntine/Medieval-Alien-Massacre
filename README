# MEDIEVAL ALIEN MASSACRE

A sadistic and pro-death text-based adventure for (bastard) children.

A hobby project, written in Clojure (A Lisp for the JVM).


## Installation (If you want to make changes. If you just want to play, skip to "Usage").

First, install Leiningen: http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

And then:

$ lein deps
$ lein uberjar

Also install rlwrap (optional, but highly recommended as it provides tab completion, history, etc):

$ sudo apt-get install rlwrap


## Usage (if you want to play)

If you've installed rlwrap:

$ ./play

Otherwise (for OSX, etc):

$ java -jar mam-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

Or see a list of standalone packages in my downloads: https://github.com/buntine/Medieval-Alien-Massacre/archives/master


## Notes

 - Type the 'help' command in gameplay for some tips and instructions.
 - Inspired by Dunnet, by Rob Schnell ($ emacs -batch -l dunnet).
