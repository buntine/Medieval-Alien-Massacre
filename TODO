- Implement all object-related commands in new deduction logic
- Also for give and put:
  - Don't ignore 'to' or 'in'.
  - Try deduce object from sublist before 'to'.
  - And deduce another from sublist after 'to'.
  - E.g: give green potion to young man (assuming player has green potion and red potion and room has young and old men)

- Think about implementing a fighting system like that of Fighting Fantasy books.
  - OR Design/implement a simple scoring system
