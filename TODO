Problems:
 - Objects with empty game desc should not be listed.
 - Room descriptions of items only shown in desc do not makes sense if the object is gone (spider web)
   - Maybe just implement as object in room?

Features:
 - Allow Curator to treat 'green-eyed' players specially.
 - Add stab command.
 - Add Adventure-esque commands for fun.
 - Think about implementing a fighting system like that of Fighting Fantasy books.
   - OR Design/implement a simple scoring system
