- Encrypt/compress savedata file.
- Multi-select objects fucks up the ability to eat a keycard.
  - Player has object 4, but the identifiers say 'key only maps to c4 in room 7.
  - Fix by having override to see if any of (vals x) is 4, etc.

  - No! Rewrite the object mapping functionality so each verb/noun can have a set of mappings.
  - The system will try to intelligently map the terms to a single object
  - If it cannot, it will say "Please be more specific".
  - green may map to #{1 4 23}
  - blue may map to #{6 43}
  - potion may map to #{6 4}
  - If player is in a room with two potions, then "drink potion" then the system will ask for more info
    because both objects 4 and 6 are in the current room.
  - "drink blue potion" will be sufficient there will now be two 6's and one 4.

- Maybe move edible side-effects into object-details
  - :edible is either false or a string or a function.
  - Or setup a general events framework.
    - :events { :eat       (fn [] "bleh"),
                :giveables { 7 (fn [] "blah") }}

- Think about implementing a fighting system like that of Fighting Fantasy books.
  - OR Design/implement a simple scoring system
