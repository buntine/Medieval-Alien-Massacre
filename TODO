- Work out how to deal with multiple key types (green, red, silver)
  - Or maybe get smart and allow for all objects to be "multi-selectable",
    that is, certain conditions are checked. E.g "boy" means object 12 in room
    7 but it means object 43 in rooms 12 and 13. Cool?
- Encrypt/compress savedata file.
- Allow for speech to execute a function.
- Add in points system.
- Add 'milestones' set so I can keep track of things the player should know.
  - The Pod Manager should not let the player leave the ship until he/she has spoken to the captain.

- Think about implementing a fighting system like that of Fighting Fantasy books.
  - OR Design/implement a simple scoring system
