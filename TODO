- Work out how to deal with multiple key types (green, red, silver)
  - Or maybe get smart and allow for all objects to be "multi-selectable",
    that is, certain conditions are checked. E.g "boy" means object 12 in room
    7 but it means object 43 in rooms 12 and 13. Cool?
- Add in "speak" command. Can be done now because of :living data for objects.
- Finish implementing load and save functionality.
- Add in points system.
- Macros: 
  - for the xx-object functions.
  - (do (println s) true)

- Think about implementing a fighting system like that of Fighting Fantasy books.
  - OR Design/implement a simple scoring system
